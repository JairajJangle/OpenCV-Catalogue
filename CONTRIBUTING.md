## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/JairajJangle/OpenCV-Catalogue/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/JairajJangle/OpenCV-Catalogue/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!



## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
